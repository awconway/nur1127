<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

You will recall from NUR1027 that quantitative studies involving *manipulation* of conditions for groups of participants included in the study can broadly be categorized as **interventional** studies. Interventional studies can be further categorized as either randomized or non-randomized. 

<img src="/interventional-studies.png">

This chapter will focus on **randomized** studies of interventions. But first, I want to take a step back and put what we are going to learn into the bigger picture. In this course we are working towards developing your ability to identify clinical questions that are important to you and your team's practice and being able to use evidence to inform your decision-making regarding those questions. In other words, as 'health systems leaders and administrators' we want you to be able to make evidence-informed 'recommendations' for practice. To assist the formation of such recommendations, the best framework for you to use is known as GRADE. The GRADE framework stands for 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Developed and Evaluation'. I introduced this framework to you briefly in the first week of NUR1027, but now, as we start to delve deeper into some important types of research designs, it is important to look into this framework in more detail. At it's core, GRADE provides a way for us to first assess the quality of evidence, and then, based on this quality assessment, provide **recommendations** for practice that are either classified as a:

1. Strong recommendation *for* a particular intervention
1. Conditional (or weak) recommendation *for* a particular intervention
1. Strong recommendation *against* a particular intervention
1. Conditional (or weak) recommendation *against* a particular intervention

One really big advantage of the GRADE framework is that it moves us away from thinking about 'hierarchies' of evidence without consideration for quality. Below is the summary of GRADE I provided in NUR1027 for you to review. What I want you to keep in mind as we move through the course this semester, is: 

<qu>What is the **strength** of the recommendation for practice I can provide either for or against this intervention, considering the quality of evidence at hand?</qu>

**The GRADE approach involves rating the quality of evidence for each outcome along a continuum of very low, low, moderate or high quality.**

<p>Evidence from a randomised controlled trial (or meta-analysis where the results of multiple randomised controlled trials have been combined using a statistical approach) is automatically assigned a rating of <em><strong>high</strong></em> quality and non-randomised studies automatically assigned a <em><strong>low</strong></em> rating. However, the evidence rating is then <em><strong>modified downward</strong> </em>if there are concerns about:</p>


- The risk of <em><strong>bias</strong></em> associated with the design of the study or studies that provided evidence for that outcome (also termed *study limitations* by GRADE);
- How <em><strong>precise</strong></em> the results of a study are (termed imprecision by GRADE);
- The degree to which results from different similar studies (comparing the same interventions for example) have <em><strong>varied</strong></em> (termed <strong>inconsistency</strong> by GRADE);
- The evidence available not being totally <em><strong>relevant</strong></em> to the research question at hand (termed indirectness by GRADE);
- The completeness of <em><strong>reporting</strong></em> of research (termed publication bias by grade).



It is also possible to <strong><em>upgrade</em></strong> the quality of evidence assigned to an outcome from a non-randomised or observational study. Upgrading evidence quality for an observational study can be considered when a dose-response gradient is present and large effects are identified (i.e. 2-5 fold reductions or increases in risk) (Guyatt et al., 2011).</p>

Your first reading for this week, is to review the GRADE framework:

<exercise id="2" title="Summary of findings table">

Again, to provide insight into the bigger picture of what I want you to be able to achieve from this course, below is an example of a **Summary of findings table**. A summary of findings table is essentially a way to summarize the results **and** the quality of evidence for the 'O' component of a clinical question that has been structured in the PICO format, <ins>**as well as**</ins>, GRADE ratings for the quality of evidence. A summary of findings table like the one shown below is what you will be expected to produce as part of your final assignment for the course. You will use the information that makes up the summary of findings table, including the effect estimate and the associated *quality* of evidence for the effect that was observed to help you produce and **justify** your recommendation for or against use of the intervention (as well as whether it is a strong or conditional/weak recommendation). Let's take a look at the example summary of findings table below and have a stab at making a recommendation. 

The example is from a Cochrane review that I have recently updated (the update is currently in the editorial process but the old version is published [here](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009491.pub2/full#CD009491-sec1-0001)). The review included only RCTs. The table is structured with rows corresponding to the different outcomes that we selected as being important for decision-making regarding the clinical question, is midazolam more effective than placebo during procedural sedation? Then there are some columns in which the effect estimates are reported and, importantly, the GRADE rating for the quality of evidence. You will note that although some outcomes have the phrase "No studies reported on this outcome" in the comments. This is a vital feature for summary of findings table. We have to be explicitly clear when there is no evidence available for an outcome that we considered important enough to pre-specify in our PICO question. 

In this circumstance, none of the studies that compared oral midazolam with placebo for sedation before a procedure reported level of sedation. The other outcomes we deemed important enough to be used to inform our decision-making about whether or not to recommend oral midazolam for pre-procedural sedation, were ratings of anxiety, ratings of pain and rating of difficulty performing procedures. To summarize, there was *low* quality evidence that midazolam reduced anxiety, there was low quality evidence that there was no important difference between midazolam and placebo in regard to the difficulty performing procedures and there was moderate quality evidence that midazolam reduced pain when given before procedures. Based on this summary of findings, we can make a *conditional* recommendation *for* using midazolam before *diagnostic* procedures in older children and adults. It is conditional in that it was based on low to moderate quality evidence for the outcomes we specified as being important to our decision-making and that not all of our outcomes were able to be assesed due to the fact that no studies reported on level of sedation. Another factor in the decision to make this a *conditional* recommendation is that the population in which the studies that reported on these outcomes, although diverse and including both children and adults, was not entirely representative of the target population of ALL procedures where sedation is commonly used. A common feature of the samples that were included in the studies that provided outcome data were that they were all procedures that were not associated with a high degree of pain and required mostly anxiolysis and motion control. As such, this reasoning informed the component of the *conditional* recommendation regarding the population.

## Risk of bias assessment

<br>

A core element of undertaking a GRADE assessment is to determine if there are study limitations or, in other words, a 'risk of bias' associated with the outcome you are interested in.The diagram below covers the types of risks of bias specifically important when undertaking appraisals of the quality of evidence prodeuced from randomized controlled trial designs.  

<img src="/bias.png"/>

Because we covered the important components of risk of bias assessment during week 6 in NUR1027, I'm not going to re-hash them again now. Here's a [link](https://player.vimeo.com/video/354402956) to the video if you want to view it again though. This semester I want to provide you with a more practical toolset, and show you how to use risk of bias assessment tools. The best resource for you to use to undertake risk of bias assessments for randomized controlled trials is the **Cochrane risk of bias tool**. Please take a moment to read through the advice provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. In the next section, there is a video of the webinar, where I will demonstrate use of this tool. For more detailed information on risk of bias assesments for randomized controlled trials, please consult sections 8.3 to 8.7 of the [Cochrane Handbook](https://training-cochrane-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/handbook/current/chapter-08#section-8-3).
