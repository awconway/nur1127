<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

This week we will cover the very important step within the 'evidence-based practice' process of making a recommendation for practice based on the available evidence. We will use the GRADE framework to do this. We have already covered in detail how to make decisions about how to interpret the results of randomized and non-randomized studies of interventions, as well as how to grade the certainty of these results using the GRADE approach, which incorporates risk of bias assessment. A first step on our way to using all that information to inform our decision about whether or not to recommend use of the intervention in practice is to produce a summary of findings table. 

</exercise>

<exercise id="2" title="Summary of findings tables">

A summary of findings table is the 'gold-standard' for succinct presentation of the magnitude of an effect estimate for outcomes that have been considered as vital to inform decision-making about recommendations for practice, along with the degree of certainty assigned to that effect estimate (i.e. the GRADE rating). 

Very detailed information about how one can go about producing summary of findings tables for both binary and continuous outcomes is provided in the readings below. I would first like to highlight some important considerations for how you can go about creating a SoF table in your assignment:

## Structure of summary of findings tables

Below you can download a 'simplified' version of a summary of findings table that you can use as a template for your assignment. You will see that there is a row for outcomes and columns related to rating the certainty of evidence, the number of patients in treatment/control groups and columns for the effect estimates. In most cases – results for ‘binary’ outcomes will be reported using ‘relative’ effect estimates, like relative risks odds ratios. For continuous outcomes, like mean difference or standardized mean difference (if it is a meta-analysis where the outcome was measured in different ways in the individual studies), these should be included in the 'absolute' column.

In circumstances where more than one study reported on the same outcome, provide a rating for the certainty of evidence *overall*. Then report the effect estimates for the individual studies separately.

:file_folder: [Summary of findings template](https://www.aaronconway.info/NUR1127/SoF-template.docx)

## How to present/interpret results of a meta-analysis that used the 'standardized mean difference' (SMD) as the effect estimate in the SOF table

There is a great deal of information provided about how to present effect estimates from meta-analyses that used standardized mean differences. To simplify things for this assignment - just report the standardized mean difference (SMD) as you would the mean difference (MD) and interpret using these 'rules of thumb' for the effect sizes [(Cochrane Handbook, 2020)](https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_12/12_6_2_re_expressing_smds_using_rules_of_thumb_for_effect_sizes.htm). 

|  SMD| Interpretation|
|--|--|
|  ~ 0.2|  Small effect|
|  ~ 0.5|  Moderate effect|
| Higher than 0.8 | Large effect |

## Reporting the 'assumed' risk

A feature of SoF tables are that they included a column for 'assumed' risk. This is typically displayed, for binary outcomes, as the proportion of patients in the __control group__ who experienced the outcome. For continuous outcomes, this is typically just the 'average' (so could be mean or median - whatever is reported) from the control group. In the case of meta-analyses, just report the range of scores from the control groups, so that readers can get a sense of what the 'typical' burden of these outcomes are in the 'control' population.

## Presentation of absolute effect across different risk groups

In section 9 and 10 of the paper addressing presentation of SoF tables for *binary outcomes*, there is information provided to assist the presentation of absolute effects as frequencies, as this is potentially easier to understand. For the purposes of this assignment, **you can do this, but you do not have to if you don't want to perform these additional calculations yourself.** In the SoF template I have provided an example for how you can present absolute effects in terms of how many _fewer_ or how many _more_ events there were in the intervention group.  The calculations are quite simple. But if you don't want to do this, just present the results as either relative risks or absolute risks (with confidence intervals hopefully - if they are provided) as they were reported in the paper. Note: don't try and calculate an absolute effect for an 'adjusted' result or an odds ratio. Just report the OR in the 'relative effect' box.

<exercise id="3" title="Evidence to decision framework">

There is evidence to suggest that clinicians overwhelmingly prefer having recommendations accompany evidence summaries for clinical situations supported by low to very low quality evidence [(Neumann et al., 2018).](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/08954356/v99icomplete/33_dcwramswawgr.xml)  The required reading below provides details about how you can use guidance from the GRADE framework to produce such recommendations (GRADE guidelines 15). By considering the following domains, you will be able to make a decision about whether to: 

1. Recommend for or against using the intervention; and 
1. whether that recommendation is *strong* or *weak*. 

The table below provides a brief summary of the considerations required in making a GRADE recommendation.

<center><strong>Domains that contribute to the strength of a recommendation</strong></center>

## Example about balancing desirable and undesirable effects in decision-making about recommendation for practice

For example, say the RR for infection associated with a new surgical wound dressing was 0.5 with 95% CI spanning from 0.2 to 0.9. This is still a ‘statistically significant’ reduction in the risk of infection, but the result is very imprecise. From the evidence we have at hand (i.e. the confidence interval), the reduction in risk of infection in the population could be anywhere between a really large reduction in risk (0.2) all the way up to only a small reduction (0.9) in risk of infection. This means we are very uncertain about where the true effect lies in the population and so we should downgrade the quality of evidence due to this concern about imprecision. The more precise the effect estimate is, we are better able to judge the desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention. To expand, say for example that another outcome we measured in an evaluation of that new surgical wound dressing was an ‘undesirable’ effect – like pain. And we found that patients who received the new wound dressing had slightly worse pain at the incision site than the comparator. We would then have to make a decision about whether or not to recommend using the new dressing by balancing the decreased risk of infection against the increased amount of pain. Considering the effect estimate for reduction in risk of infection was very imprecise a ‘conditional’ recommendation to use the new dressing is probably warranted because patients may ‘value’ decreased pain during their recovery after surgery higher than a potentially only very small reduction in the risk of infection (remember upper limit of confidence interval was 0.9). If, for example, the RR for infection was much more precise - RR still 0.5 but instead the 95% CI were 0.45 to 0.55, we might instead opt for a ‘strong’ recommendation to use the new surgical dressing because, on balance, the gain from reducing risk of infection would outweigh the small increase in pain.

## Sourcing evidence about patient values and preferences

The extent of information available about patient values and preferences regarding the outcomes you included in your PICO question will vary greatly depending on how 'common' the outcome you selected is. In your assignment, you should include a statement that clearly identifies whether or not you were able to locate any evidence regarding patient values and preferences about the outcomes you included in your PICO. However, we should note that evidence on patients' values and preferences is limited [(Andrews et al., 2013)](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/08954356/v66i0007/726_gg1gfeoardas.xml). For this reason, _in your assignment you will likely find that you will need to rely on your own clinical experiences to make judgements about patient values and preferences_ when considering the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects for the intervention.  Something to remember is that your clinical experience may lead you to believe that patients' values vary considerably within the population and this may mean you will be more likely to provide a 'conditional' recommendation for or against use of the intervention [(Andrews et al., 2013)](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/08954356/v66i0007/726_gg1gfeoardas.xml). **Just be clear about *how* you considered patient values and preferences (whether that was with primary evidence from research on patient preferences/values or your own clinical experience) when deciding on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects associated with the intervention**. 

<qu>Table 3 in the GRADE guidelines-15 article provides a useful structure for you to work through in making your practice recommendation. You don't need to include a table like this in the assignment, but it provides a clear process for you to work through to decide on your final recommendation and the information you might like to include to justify your decision.</qu> 

## Resources/feasibility

Consideration of the resources required to implement an intervention is required to determine the strength of a recommendation. As is the case for considering patient values, you may be able to identify evidence of primary research studies to determine the costs for interventions. However, many interventions will not have evidence available from cost-effectiveness analyses to support decision-making. If there is high uncertainty of clinical effectiveness for a very costly intervention, it is not likely that a strong recommendation is warranted. Alternatively, if there is low-moderate quality evidence of a benefit for an intervention that is not costly without a high risk of adverse effects (maybe exercise or some sort of lifestyle-type intervention), then on balance you may decide for a strong recommendation to implement the interventions based on those considerations. 

<qu>Again - just be clear about how you considered resource requirements in your judgement about whether or not to recommend an intervention for use in practice. What I want to see in these assignments is that you understand the process of how the certainty of evidence for the desirable and undesirable effects associated with an intervention may be assessed with consideration for patient values/preferences and resource constraints to come up with an overall judgement about whether or not to use the intervention in practice. The recommendation you decide doesn't have to be 'right' - it just has to be supported appropriately by the process outlined in the GRADE framework. The GRADE framework is the gold standard for guideline recommendations so understanding how the framework can be applied is going to be a very useful skill and knowledge base for your future work as leaders in health services.

<exercise id="4" title="Examples of practice recommendations from the BMJ">

The BMJ provides great [examples](https://www.bmj.com/rapid-recommendations) of practice recommendations using the GRADE approach. The visual displays of information are particularly informative - but of course it is not expected that you need to produce anything like this for your assignment. What I would like you to take note of from these examples, are the statements around how the guideline panels' considered 'preferences and values' and 'resourcing' to justify their decision-making. You will see that not all of the recommendations were able to be informed by 'high-quality' evidence for patient values and preferences or resourcing. In these cases, it was just clearly stated how the 'panel' came to their decision (i.e. based on clinical experience in most cases). For your assignment - *you are the 'panel'*.

</exercise>

<exercise id="5" title="Assignment structure">

As this assignment is very much about communicating judgements that *you* make regarding risk of bias assessments, certainty of evidence, the strength of recommendations etc, it is very much appropriate for you to use the first person. So statements like, "I downgraded the certainty of evidence for this outcome to moderate quality due to concerns about risk of bias", are completely acceptable.

|Section|Words|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Introduction| ~200| Provide an overview of the topic and justify your selection of the PICO components.|
|Selection of studies|~400| Describe the methods/main results of the studies you selected to include. Justify why they were relevant to the PICO. (Note: remember that in GRADE there is the concept of 'indirectness', so if a study didn't include your *exact* population, it may still provide relevant evidence, it's just that you may need to consider downgrading for indirectness). |
|Critical appraisal of studies|~600 words| This is where you will talk about the risk of bias assessments/components of the interventions and comparators (i.e. TIDieR checklist). So about 200 word summary for each study/outcome.|
|Synthesis of evidence| ~500 words| This is where you will refer to the SoF table you have produced and justify your GRADE ratings for the overall certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes you included in your PICO.|
|Recommendations| ~300 words| This is where you provide your GRADE recommendation to either use the intervention or not (as well as the strength of the recommendation) based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable outcomes, incorporating consideration of the *certainty* of this evidence and patient values/preferences as well as feasibility (resource implications). |

## References

Although this is a fairly substantial assignment, the list of references you use does not have to be particularly large. I would expect you to be citing the relevant papers that assist you to draw your conclusions about your risk of bias assessments and decisions about downgrading for certainty of evidence. So for example, if you downgrade an outcome for imprecision, explain how you made this decision and cite a reference for the guidance you used to make that decision. This means you'd be citing a lot of the 'GRADE guidelines' papers etc from your required readings from the relevant weeks when we covered RCTS, NRSI etc. If you draw upon any primary evidence to support decisions about patient values and preferences and resourcing considerations for interventions when making practice recommendations - these should of course also be supported by references. 


</exercise>

<exercise id="6" title="A note on including systematic reviews/meta-analysis">

As you all know, systematic reviews with meta-analyses that were conducted well are very useful for clinicians because it saves them from the time-consuming tasks of having to locate evidence, select relevant studies, undertake risk of bais assessments and synthesise results (potentially using meta-analysis). But you also are well aware that if the quality of the methods used to undertake the systematic review are not appropriate (i.e. elements of the AMSTAR tool), then the results of the SR/MA really should not be used to inform our practice.

So for your assignment, you _can_ select a systematic review with meta-analysis as one of your 3 studies. As part of the 'critical appraisal' section of the assignment you would undertake an assessment of the quality of the SR/MA (using AMSTAR) so that you can decide whether or not the results of that meta-analysis are valid enough to be used to inform clinical practice. **If you decide that the methods used in the systematic review were not appropriate, then you would not include the meta-analysis result in your summary of findings table. Be sure to include a rationale with supporting evidence for this decision though.**

This means that I would strongly suggest that you only select, *at most*, 1 SR/MA for your assignment. This is because a large component of you mark will be about your ability to 'synthesise' evidence (i.e. produce a SoF table) and make recommendations for practice. If you select 2 or 3 meta-analyses and they are all poor quality, then you won't have anything to synthesise.
