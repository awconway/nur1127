<exercise id="1" title="Course overview">

Welcome to NUR1127. Much of the structure of this course is similar to NUR1027 in that there will be weekly learning content comprising videos, exercises and written material as well as required and additional reading resources provided. Please read through the page to learn more about the course structure and assignment requirements. Also, don't forget to view the [syllabus](https://nur1127syllabus.netlify.app).

<exercise id="4" title="Discussion boards" >

The discussion boards will be run slightly differently to NUR1027. This is because I wanted to be able to provide students with the learning material required to complete your presentations in advance. For this reason, the topics for the discussion boards will not always align with the 'weekly learning content'.

### Research summary and recommendations

This assignment is a culmination of the content we have covered throughout NUR1027 and NUR1127. Students will compile, review, critically appraise, and synthesize research evidence about a topic or question, and prepare a summary of findings  table using the GRADE approach (to be appended). 

- The topic/question should address a practice situation that calls for a specific strategy or direction (covered in detail in NUR1027)
- The literature review must include 3 published research studies (strategies for identifying relevant literature covered in NUR1027).
- You will provide a description of key features of each study, substantive results, and major strengths and limitations (general concepts introduced in NUR1027 and followed up on issues specific to certain important types of research designs in NUR1127) in the body of paper along with specific details to justify the ratings for quality of evidence included in the summary of findings table. 
- The assignment will conclude with overall conclusions regarding the state of the evidence, and a GRADE recommendation to address the practice issue or situation. (NUR1127 will cover content related to making practice recommendations using the GRADE framework).

## Assignment 5

### Online participation

Your participation in the five discussion boards over the course of the semester is optional.

We are looking to see that you provide regular and thoughtful contributions that push the conversation to a deeper level and encourage others to join.

There will be fewer discussion boards than last semester.  There will be 5 discussion topics in total, with up to 2 points per discussion topic contributing to the overall grade.
