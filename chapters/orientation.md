<exercise id="1" title="Course overview">

Welcome to NUR1127. Much of the structure of this course is similar to NUR1027 in that there will be weekly learning content comprising videos, exercises and written material as well as required and additional reading resources provided. Please read through the page to learn more about the course structure and assignment requirements. Also, don't forget to view the [syllabus](https://www.aaronconway.info/NUR1127/Syllabus/Syllabus.html).

<exercise id="4" title="Discussion boards" >

The discussion boards will be run slightly differently to NUR1027. This is because some of the discussion boards will be led by student groups as part of the first assignment. Please also note that I wanted to be able to provide students with the learning material required to complete your presentations and moderate the discussion boards in advance. For this reason, the topics for the discussion boards will not always align with the 'weekly learning content'. 

- 5 discussion boards in total - 2 marks each.
- Weeks 4,5 and 6 will be led by student groups

## Assignment 1

### Critical Appraisal and Interpretation of a Research Study

The first assignment for this course is a group-based task. You have already been assigned to a group. Please go to the 'People' tab in Quercus to view the group you have been assigned. 

For the assignment you will work with the other members of your group to present a review and critical appraisal of a research study. You will need to select a research article provided in the weekly learning content. 

### Presentation

Students will provide a slide presentation with voiceover (10 minutes maximum, 8-10 slides), to be posted on Voicethread and will also facilitate the online discussion in Quercus. The presentation should include a brief summary of the study approach (purpose, design, setting and sample, methods), presentation and interpretation of results, and discussion of key strengths and limitations.

## Assignment 4

### Research summary and recommendations

This assignment is a culmination of the content we have covered throughout NUR1027 and NUR1127. Students will compile, review, critically appraise, and synthesize research evidence about a topic or question, and prepare a summary of findings  table using the GRADE approach (to be appended). 

- The topic/question should address a practice situation that calls for a specific strategy or direction (covered in detail in NUR1027)
- The literature review must include 3 published research studies (strategies for identifying relevant literature covered in NUR1027).
- You will provide a description of key features of each study, substantive results, and major strengths and limitations (general concepts introduced in NUR1027 and followed up on isses specific to certain important types of research designs in NUR1127) in the body of paper along with specific details to justify the ratings for quality of evidence included in the summary of findings table. 
- The assignment will conclude with overall conclusions regarding the state of the evidence, and 2-3 GRADE recommendations from your three studies to address the practice issue or situation (NUR1127 will cover content related to making practice recommendations using the GRADE framework).  

**35% of grade**

## Assignment 5

### Online participation

Your participation in the five discission boards over the course of the semester will contribute to your grade.

We are looking to see that you provide regular and thoughtful contributions that push the conversation to a deeper level and encourage others to join.

There will be fewer discussion boards than last semester.  There will be 5 discussion topics in total, with up to 2 points per discussion topic contributing to the overall grade. As such, the intensity and frequency of your posts will need to increase accordingly. I will expect that you contribute at least one post before Thursday each week and that 2 posts are at least 48 hours apart from each other. At least one original and 2 replies are required.
