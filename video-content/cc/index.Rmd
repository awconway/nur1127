|Strengths | Limitations |
|--- | --- |
|Efficient way to collect large amounts of data when intervention/ randomization is not possible| No randomization|
|Does not require artificial provision of exposure|Rival explanations for results (e.g., confounding variables)|
|Treatments not withheld|Can require large sample sizes (e.g., cohort)|

| Result  |   Interpretation|
|---|---|
| RR = 1 | Incidence in the exposed group is the same as the unexposed group- no association; risk is the same for both groups|
| RR >1 | Incidence in the exposed group is greater than the incidence in the unexposed group, there is an increased risk or positive association |
| RR <1 | Incidence in the exposed group is lower than the incidence in the unexposed group, there is a decreased risk or negative association |

| Result  |   Interpretation|
|---|---|
| OR = 1 | exposure does not affect odds of disease |

| OR < 1 | exposure is associated with lower odds of disease (i.e. a 'negative' association between exposure and outcome)|

### <i class="fas fa-times-square"></i> Reducing bias in Cohort and Case-Control Studies

---

class: left middle hide-count


| Type of bias  | Explanation|   Cohort study | Case-Control Study |
|---|---| --- |---|
| Selection bias| Groups differ on prognostic factors (variables that are associated with the outcome)| Statistical adjustment for confounders (measure the variables and include them in the statistical model to produce an effect estimate that is 'adjusted' for the effect of the confounder)| Matching of cases and controls on confounders (e.g. age, sex)|
|Recall bias| Due to participant beliefs/awareness| Less of an issue due to prospective nature of data collection| Exposures selected that are more objective (to minimize recall bias) or don't require much participant recall|
|Detection bias| Bias in measurement of outcomes and exposures| Objective outcomes, blinding of outcome assessors| Clear definitions for 'cases' and blinding the assessor of exposures to case/control status|
|Attrition bias| Missing outcome data| <li>Incentives to keep participants in the study </li><li>Impute missing data</li>| Losing participants is not a big issue but data may be missing for exposures if relying on retrospective data|
