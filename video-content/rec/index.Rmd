## Benefits
</center>
- “Pre-processed” resources that synthesize a relevant body of evidence
- Refine clinical questions and balance trade-offs between benefits and risks
- Usually provide explicit recommendations to guide decision making
]

.pull-right[
<center>
## Limitations
</center>
- Require tailoring to specific context of application (e.g. clinical setting, geographical location, etc.)
- Must be updated in light of research developments

class: left middle hide-count

1. Presenting 'assumed' risks as natual frequencies and 'corresponding' risks as the number of events 'fewer' or 'more'

1. Presenting confidence intervals using more natural language (eg. "7 fewer to 8 more")

1. Providing rationale for decisions about downgrading certainty of evidence

## Values and preferences

class: center middle hide-count

## Strong recommendation

>The panel believes that all or almost all patients would place a high value on avoiding even minimal risk of complications and burden from surgery, if it is not helpful

---

class: center middle hide-count

## Conditional recommendation

>The panel believes that there is a great _variability_ on how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. Shared decision making may help establish what matters most to each patient.

### Evidence on patients' values and preferences is limited

### Draw on your own clinical experiences to make judgements about patient values and preferences when considering the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects for the intervention

## Resource considerations

---

class: left middle hide-count

- High uncertainty of clinical effectiveness for a very costly intervention, it is not likely that a strong recommendation is warranted. 

- Low-moderate quality evidence of a benefit for an intervention that is not costly without a high risk of undesirable effects (maybe exercise or some sort of lifestyle-type intervention), then on balance you may decide for a strong recommendation. 

- You could be very uncertain about the potential impact on resources (inadequate reporting of intervention details - TIDieR) - this may warrant a conditional recommendation.

## Strong recommendation (limited benefits do not outweigh high costs)
