<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

This week we will cover the very important step within the 'evidence-based practice' process of making a recommendation for practice based on the available evidence. We will use the GRADE framework to do this. We have already covered in detail how to make decisions about how to interpret the results of randomized and non-randomized studies of interventions, as well as how to grade the certainty of these results using the GRADE approach, which incorporates risk of bias assessment. A first step on our way to using all that information to inform our decision about whether or not to recommend use of the intervention in practice is to produce a summary of findings table. 

</exercise>

<exercise id="2" title="Summary of findings tables">

A summary of findings table is the 'gold-standard' for succinct presentation of the magnitude of an effect estimate for outcomes that have been considered as vital to inform decision-making about making recommendations for practice, along with the degree of certainty assigned to that effect estimate (i.e. the GRADE rating). 

Very detailed information about how one can go about producing summary of findings tables for both binary and continuous outcomes is provided in the readings below. I would first like to highlight some important considerations for how you can go about creating a SoF table in your assignment:

<qu>Structure of summary of findings tables</qu>

Below you can download a 'simplified' version of a summary of findings table that you can use as a template for your assignment. You will see that there is a row for outcomes and columns related to rating the certainty of evidence, the number of patients in treatment/control groups and columns for the effect estimates. In most cases – results for ‘binary’ outcomes will be reported using ‘relative’ effect estimates, like relative risks odds ratios. They may report ‘absolute effects’ so you are also welcome to also/instead include those effect estimates. For continuous outcomes, like mean difference or standardized mean difference (if it is a meta-analysis where the outcome was measured in different ways in the individual studies), these should be included in the 'absolute' column.

In circumstances where more than one study reported on the same outcome, provide a rating for the certainty of evidence *overall*. Then report the effect estimates for the individual studies separately.

<qu>How to present/interpret results of a meta-analysis that used the 'standardized mean difference' (SMD) as the effect estimate in the SoF table</qu>

There is a great deal of information provided about how to present effect estimates from meta-analyses that used standardized mean differences. To simplify things for this assignment - just report the standardized mean difference (SMD) as you would the mean difference (MD) and interpret using these 'rules of thumb' for the effect sizes [(Cochrane Handbook, 2020)](https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_12/12_6_2_re_expressing_smds_using_rules_of_thumb_for_effect_sizes.htm). 

|  SMD| Interpretation|
|--|--|
|  ~ 0.2|  Small effect|
|  ~ 0.5|  Moderate effect|
| Higher than 0.8 | Large effect |

<qu>Reporting the 'assumed' risk</qu>

A feature of SoF tables are that they included a column for 'assumed' risk. This is typically displayed, for binary outcomes, as the proportion of patients in the __control group__ who experienced the outcome. For continuous outcomes, this is typically just the 'average' (so could be mean or median - whatever is reported) from the control group. In the case of meta-analyses, just report the range of scores from the control groups, so that readers can get a sense of what the 'typical' burden of these outcomes are in the 'control' population.

<qu>Presentation of absolute effect across different risk groups</qu>

In section 9 of the paper addressing presentation of SoF tables for *binary outcomes*, there is information provided to assist the presentation of absolute effects as frequencies, as this is potentially easier to understand. For the purposes of this assignment, **you do not have to do this.** Just present the results as either relative risks or absolute risks (with confidence intervals hopefully - if they are provided) as they were provided in the paper.

<exercise id="3" title="Evidence to decision framework">

There is evidence to suggest that clinicians overwhelmingly prefer having recommendations accompanying evidence summaries for clinical situations supported by low to very low quality evidence [(Neumann et al., 2018).](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/08954356/v99icomplete/33_dcwramswawgr.xml)  The required reading below provides details about how you can use guidance from the GRADE framework to produce such recommendations (GRADE guidelines 15). By considering the following domains, you will be able to make a decision about whether to: 1) recommend for or against using the intervention; and 2) whether that recommendation is *strong* or *weak*. The table below provides a brief summary of the considerations required in making a GRADE recommendation.

<center><strong>Domains that contribute to the strength of a recommendation</strong></center>
